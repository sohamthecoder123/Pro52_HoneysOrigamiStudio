                        <li>Rabbits are cute, and are found in many places</li>
                        <li>They are also pretty soft</li>
                        <li>They are often confused with hares or jackrabbits. To identify a hare from a rabbit, take a look at the size. Hares are often larger than rabbits</li>

                    <p><b>Some Facts about Butterflies</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Butterflies are beautiful insects, that are often found during the day.</li>
                        <li>They actually look very different from their larvae, which later undergo metamorphosis</li>
                        <li>Like rabbits, they are often confused with moths. The way to tell them apart is to see how they perch. Butterflies often perch with wings closed, while moths with wings open</li>
